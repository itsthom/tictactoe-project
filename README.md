Summer 2013

This is a project from an Intro AI class. 
Contains a interfaces and classes for representation of a Tic Tac Toe board and
AI players. 
One player class uses Minimax search to explore the entire game space, and the 
other uses a limited-depth Minimax search with a heuristic function.

TO DO (maybe):
 - Add a human player class
 - Some kind of menu for setting up games
 - make GUI
